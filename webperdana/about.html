                <p>Hello there,
                    I'm obsessed with something detailed, paying attention to all of the small things when working on a task or activity. Manage anything to meet aggressive timelines and accomplish goals. These two main things make me feel suitable and able to perform in the field of administration. During my study at Vocational High School, I also take certifications in Administration and have several working experiences to improve my competency. 
                <p>Life goes on and I need to explore my potential and competency in another field, then I choose Computer Science/Informatics as my major in university. Why I choose this major because in todayâ€™s data-driven society, informatics is everywhere and I am intrigued by how websites, applications, and games work amazingly and easily. Another reason is I've been only a software user, so I need to develop software programs that will help millions of people.</p>    
                <p>If you reading this and you are someone who's in the same field as me, let's connect and study together or maybe we can develop programs in the future.</p>
